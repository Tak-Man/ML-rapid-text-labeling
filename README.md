# ML-rapid-text-labeling
Using machine-learning to enable a user to rapidly label a large text corpus.

This repo was originally produce for the final Capstone project for the University of Michigan Masters in Applied Data Science. It contains code to evaluate and analyze the performance of another repo also produced for that project on [rapid text labeling](https://github.com/Tak-Man/ML-rapid-text-labeling-app). The other repo contains a working web app that implements a variety of Data Science techniques to enable a user to rapidly label a text corpus and have control over how they manage the trade-off between accuracy and speed in the labeling process.

The code in this repo includes:
* Automation code to interact with the web app and measure the speed and accuracy of model trained on the labels provided into the app against a test set. This is a way of measuring how effectively the app allows a user to rapidly and accurately label a text corpus within the bounds of the inevitable speed vs accuracy trade-off. This automation code is located in [web-testing](https://github.com/Tak-Man/ML-rapid-text-labeling/tree/main/web-testing) for example in the main [web automation script](https://github.com/Tak-Man/ML-rapid-text-labeling/blob/main/web-testing/web_automate2.py). This folder also contains some analysis of the results of these evaluation experiments on the app, for example in this [automation results evaluation notebook](https://github.com/Tak-Man/ML-rapid-text-labeling/tree/main/web-testing/simulation_eda2.ipynb). The analysis shows that the web app performed well in terms of speed and accuracy. Specifically the experiments conducted showed that the web app resulted in a time-saving of 82% in user labeling. For more details see the [blog](https://michp-ai.github.io/ML-rapid-text-labeling/).
* Analysis of Benchmarks that could be achieved in terms of speed and accuracy outside the app. This was done as an exercise to understand things like, what is the best accuracy that can be achieved using all the training data and labels against the test data? What is the best model in terms of speed and accuracy? What hyperparamaters would work well in the vectorizer in terms of speed and accuracy? All of these type of questions are covered in notebooks and resulting visualizations found in the [baseline classifier](https://github.com/Tak-Man/ML-rapid-text-labeling/tree/main/baseline-classifier) folder. This analysis indicated that the SGDClassifier achieved the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, and, that the initial vectorizer settings in the web app could be changed to enhance the accuracy with very little cost in terms of speed.
