# ML-rapid-text-labeling
Using machine-learning to enable a user to rapidly label a large text corpus.

This repo was originally produce for the final Capstone project for the University of Michigan Masters in Applied Data Science. It contains code to evaluate and analyze the performance of another repo also produced for that project on [rapid text labeling](https://github.com/Tak-Man/ML-rapid-text-labeling-app). The other repo contains a working web app that implements a variety of Data Science techniques to enable a user to rapidly label a text corpus and have control over how they manage the trade-off between accuracy and speed in the labeling process.

The code in this repo includes:
* selenium automated code to interact with the web app and measure accuracy of model trained on the labels provided into the app against a test set.
* Analysis of Benchmarks that could be achieved in terms of speed and accuracy outside the app.
* Comparison of different models in the same circumstances

The analysis shows that the web app performed well in terms of speed and accuracy. Specifically the experiments conducted showed that the web app resulted in a time-saving of 82% in user labeling. For more details see the [blog](https://michp-ai.github.io/ML-rapid-text-labeling/).
